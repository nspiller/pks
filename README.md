# Vibronic coupling model in mixed-valence complexes
[Piepho, Krausz and Schatz (PKS)](https://doi.org/10.1021/ja00478a011) 
introduced vibronic coupling in the Heisenberg double exchange model.
[Henthorn et al](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-021-00853-5) related the PKS model to mixed-valent
Fe dimers with intermediate spin states.

This repo contains a single Jupyter notebook, which includes the PKS energy expression.
It can be opened interactively with [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nspiller/pks/HEAD?labpath=PKS.ipynb) to explore the interplay between the parameters 
J, B, and lambda^2/k.
